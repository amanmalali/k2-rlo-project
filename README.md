# k2-rlo-project
## Summary
The current application is a web-based, browser game that runs on javascript and a simple, lean backend comprised of XML data and flask integration. It currently contains competitive elements and features but that isn't the goal of the MVP. The project goal (detailed below) is to serve as a measurement tool for the computational thinking abilities of yound students from K-2.
Core Features should include:
 - Core game mechanic of organizing recipes and breaking down a complex problem into a series of simple steps
 - The ability for teachers and students to input cultural cuisine/recipes
 - Engage multiple forms of sensory feedback, achieve a high level of accessibility within the task constraints.
 - Cross-platform, open-sourced content
## Goal
This project aims to analyze and improve the computational thinking skills of students in K2 and beyond, by creating an application to test these skills using the real world example of cooking recipes. It should serve as a fun, useful metric for teachers to gauge a students ability in this particular task.
## Intended learning outcomes (ILOs) for students:
Students should be able to analyze real world examples and break them down into their constituent steps. They should also be able to apply algorithmic skills to further order these steps sequentially, similar to how they would perform them in the real world.
## Structure
## Features
 - Core Game Mechanic
 - User login
 - Recipe and background image storage
 - Changing background
 - Audio system
 - Demo and tutorial
 - (Deprecated) Colored text feedback
 - (Deprecated) Scoring system
 - (Deprecated) Ranked game-mode
## Future Work
 - Adding a grocery system to gather ingredients for a recipe
 - Passively montoring student metrics for teacher assessment
 - Creating student analytics for teachers (mean, mode, std of points, time spent on a problem, etc...)
 - Developing the data storage and backend systems away from XML
 - Restructring the frontend with React
